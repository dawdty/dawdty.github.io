  <p><strong>personal servers</strong>, also known as personal building servers, were a feature on roblox that allowed players to create and share single-instance, persistent building worlds. removed on june 8th, 2016 due to moderation complexities, performance issues, and the release of team create, the once thriving community hubs&ndash;where players could do anything from host interactive game shows to found their own functioning towns&ndash;completely disappeared.</p>

<p>nearly a decade later, i still remember these games. personal servers were a unique experience where emergent gameplay was king, representing a class of game whose main feature&ndash;creative engagement&ndash;was sacrificed for scalability. the hours i spent building airplanes using a physics glitch involving a toilet or putting explosives on the end of a crudely engineered catapult were experiences i still consider formative to my creative slant.</p>
<p><img src="/images/catapult.gif" alt="catapult"></p>
<p>in this article i document my first steps towards a modern adaptation of the personal server &ndash; a persistent building system.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-foundation"><strong>building a foundation</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>while it would be nice to have a single-instance building experience, achieving true single-instance games in roblox is hacky and unreliable. instead, we&rsquo;ll associate build data with individual players, who will be able to load and save their same builds across instances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we need to store users&rsquo; creations somewhere in the cloud. so we first must understand the difference between roblox&rsquo;s two cloud storage services: <strong>datastores</strong> and <strong>memorystores.</strong> datastores are persistent, cloud-backed storage systems designed to save data between play sessions. memorystores are a low latency, high throughput service that provides storage accessible across all servers. however, despite being fast, this storage is not designed to be large and expires, so <strong>datastores</strong> are the best choice.</p>
<p>cool, we know exactly what we&rsquo;ll use to store our builds. but a datastore is essentially a dictionary, and players&rsquo; builds are instances. so how do we transform one into another and vice-versa?</p>
<h3 id="serialization"><strong>serialization</strong></h3>
<p>instance serialization is the process of transforming instances into formatted text. normally, this is manually implemented by roblox devs depending on what exactly they need to be stored in the cloud. this makes sense: the less objects you need to serialize, the less cloud storage is used. but today there are better solutions to this problem (recursive ones even). one of them is the excellently made <a href="https://github.com/Gem-API/Rose">RoSe</a> by Gem_API, which reduces the serialization and deserialization process to two lines:</p>





<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-lua" data-lang="lua"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">-- To turn an Instance into a table:</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">local</span> rose_table <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> rose.serialize(instance)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e">-- To turn a Rose table back into an Instance:</span>

<h3 id="packing"><strong>packing</strong></h3>
<p>for each player&rsquo;s build, we&rsquo;ll use a prefix + their unique playerid as a key to access their data.</p>

<p>next, we&rsquo;ll implement the slightly more complicated load function. while it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need to take both the player and a CFrame as an argument, i built a separate script to record the player&rsquo;s mouse position when placing the model. the first part of the script is essentially the reverse of save()&rsquo;s last bits.</p>
